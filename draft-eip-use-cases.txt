1.  Introduction

   EIP (Extensible In-band Processing) extends the functionality of IPv6
   layer to support the requirements of future Internet services / 6G
   networks.  In a nutshell, IPv6 nodes (routers and hosts) can read/
   write EIP information in packet headers to support different use
   cases.

   EIP provides a common architectural and protocol framework which can
   be tailored for the different use cases.  The EIP header includes a
   number of EIP Information Elements.  Each use case will have its own
   specific architectural aspects and protocol specifications (EIP
   Information Elements).

   In this document, some use cases for EIP are discussed.  The EIP
   architecture is discussed in [id-eip-arch].  The EIP Information
   Elements are described in [id-eip-headers].

2.  Use cases (high level description)

2.1.  Advanced monitoring

   Traditional network monitoring solutions are based on the centralized
   collection of monitoring data collected by network nodes (SNMP/
   Netflow).  These traditional solutions are "slow" and have
   scalability issues.  They are not meant to monitor a large number of
   single flows in real time, they are meant to monitor large aggregates
   of flows (e.g. all traffic flowing on a given link).  Typical time
   scale of the reaction time of the management system is in the order
   of minutes (e.g. 1-5 minutes).

   The traditional approach separates the data plane and the management
   plane.  The nodes collect counters and statistics, then they
   communicate with the NMS (Network Management Stations) over the
   management plane.  Current technologies make it possible to define
   more complex monitoring operations to be performed by nodes in the
   data plane.  The protocol extensibility offered by EIP is the natural
   complement to this new advanced monitoring approach.  Thanks to
   information carried in the EIP header, it is possible to use the data
   plane also to synchronize monitoring operations across different
   nodes and it is possible to collect monitoring information in real
   time.  Data plane entities can be used to sample and aggregate
   monitoring information.

2.2.  Semantic Routing

   The Internet Draft
   [I-D.draft-farrel-irtf-introduction-to-semantic-routing] provides a
   brief introduction to Semantic Routing.  The Internet Draft
   [I-D.draft-king-irtf-semantic-routing-survey] includes a survey of
   several approaches that can be classified under the umbrella term
   Semantic Routing.

   EIP can support Semantic Routing, in the cases where it is needed to
   place information in additional fields of the packets.  Specific EIP
   Information Elements can be defined to carry the information needed
   by Semantic Routing.

   One example is "geo-tagging", i.e. encoding the geographical position
   of a node in the IPv6 headers, so that this information can be used
   (also) for taking forwarding decisions.  A Geo-tagging EIP
   Information Element can be defined, which can be used by a node to
   provide its location or to indicate the location of a destination
   node.

2.3.  Deterministic Networking

   [RFC8655] and [RFC8938] respectively specify the Architecture and
   data Plane Framework for Deterministic Networking.  [RFC8939]
   specifies the IP data plane for DetNet, with this design choice:
   existing IP-layer and higher-layer protocol header information is
   used to support flow identification and DetNet service delivery.
   There are known limitations in the current IP data plane for DetNet,
   as discussed in [RFC8939].  In particular, the IP data plane for
   DetNet, uses 6-tuple-based flow identification, where "6-tuple" is
   destination address, source address, IP protocol, source port,
   destination port, and DSCP (optional matching on the IPv6 Flow Label
   field).  Flow aggregation may be enabled via the use of wildcards,
   masks, lists, prefixes, and ranges.  IP tunnels may also be used to
   support flow aggregation.  The result of this design is:

   *  Operational complexity: from a practical standpoint, this means
      that all nodes along the end-to-end path of DetNet flows need to
      agree on what fields are used for flow identification.  Possible
      consequences of not having such an agreement include some flows
      interfering with other flows, and the traffic treatment expected
      for a service not being provided.

   *  Lack of unified end-to-end sequencing information: service
      protection (if enabled) cannot be provided end to end, only within
      sub-networks.

   EIP is used to add explicit DetNet information in IP packets.  This
   simplifies the implementation of Deterministic Networking in IP
   routers and hosts and provides additional features with respect to
   current support of Detnet in IP networks.

   EIP adds the support of explicit Detnet flow identification and
   sequencing information.
